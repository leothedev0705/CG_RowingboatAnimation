# Rowing Animation

A simple 2D rowing animation created in Turbo C for VGA displays.

## Description

This project demonstrates basic 2D graphics programming techniques using Turbo C. It creates a rowing boat animation optimized for legacy hardware and VGA displays.

- Static boat hull with animated water, oars, and rowers
- Synchronized rowing movements through 4 stroke phases
- Basic parallax scrolling for depth perception
- Simple collision detection
- User-controlled animation speed

## Requirements

- Turbo C compiler
- VGA-compatible display
- DOSBox (for running on modern systems)
